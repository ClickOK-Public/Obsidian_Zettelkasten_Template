# Contents


```ad-help
This directory is essentially the same purpose as the "Fleeting Notes" directory. However this directory provides a container intended specifically for "**Lecture Notes**" to declutter provide better organization.

The note itself is devided into 6 sections. The idea behind the structure is to organize the information to be easily retrivable, yet simple to navigate when taking notes on-the-fly.

The "*Lecture_Notes*" template is made available for this type of note.
