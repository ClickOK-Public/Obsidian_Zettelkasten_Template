# Obsidian_Zettelkasten_Template
"Obsidian Zettelkasten Template"; A modified Zettelkasten notetaking method and structure using Obisidian.

The provided directory structure is my personal take on organizing notes and source materials by applying the well-known zettelkasten method on a digital media.

"Help" files for each of the directories, explaining their purpose and intended use. Example files are created for "Day Planner" and Kanban board, than can be easily expanded upon.

There is a directory for prepared for attachments. All inserted files are considered attachments. PDF, Word files, graphics and other binary files are automatically uploaded to "09_Attachments".

External plugins are used to provided the extra functionalities required to used Day Planner and Kanban. These can be disabled to provide more security (Prevent external JS code to run).

The whole Obsidian "Vault" is otherwise locally contained. It is therefore easy to backup or upload to Github to give the application a, although not optimal, collaborative functionality.

See https://obsidian.md for more detail regarding the application it self. Read more about zettelkasten on Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten.

There are also many YouTube videos explaining the method and how to use and implement it. Check out:
